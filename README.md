<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I originally made this game for PC a few years ago for a game jam, you can take a look at it on [fergarram.itch.io](https://fergarram.itch.io/amateur-archaeology-iii).

I also wrote a devlog for this project which you can read at [dev.to/fergarram](dev.to/fergarram).

The game is written in ES6 using Canvas with a WebGL context. I didn't use any wrapper, library or framework for WebGL except for a math utility lib written by [webglfundamentals.org](https://webglfundamentals.org/).

The simulator was made using [Svelte](svelte.dev), and the device graphics were traced by hand using a photo of my real Banana Phone using Sketch.

I also created a [template](https://github.com/Fergarram/banana-app) for creating similarly-styled KaiOS apps which includes the source code for the simulator.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Building The Project

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Simulator And Bundling
For using the simulator and packaging the app you only need NPM:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fergarram/amateur-archaeology.git

npm install

# Local server for the simulator (game included)
npm run dev

# Static files for the simulator (game included)
npm run build:sim

# KaiOS App Package (Develpment)
npm run build

# KaiOS App Package (Production)
npm run build:prod
```

### Using KaiOS Devices

If you want to run this on your real KaiOS device, you need to first enable development mode on it by dialing `*#*#33284#*#*`. You should be able to see a small bug icon on the status bar of your device.

Then, you need to make sure your device is detected by the adb tool:
```
> adb devices

List of devices attached
4939400 device
```

After making sure your device is connected, you need to run the following command to forward your devices debugging TCP port:
```
adb forward tcp:6000 localfilesystem:/data/local/debugger-socket
```

Open up Firefox 49.0 (Version is very important!) WebIDE and click on the "Remote Runtime" and then click ok when the popup message appears. Lastly, you select the app-package folder and simply click on the play button.

Setting up the environment for developing on for KaiOS can be tricky at first, you can take a look at this [article](https://nolanlawson.com/2019/09/22/the-joy-and-challenge-of-developing-for-kaios/) for more info on that, or read the official documentation at [developer.kaiostech.com](https://developer.kaiostech.com/).
